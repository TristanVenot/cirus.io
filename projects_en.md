    <h2>Brain Computer Interface</h2>
    <p>
      A non-invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) allows communication with an external device without surgery, by recording brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG).  
      These systems decode specific neural patterns associated with different mental states or cognitive processes. 
      Our approach goes beyond simple decoding: we design robust, user-centered systems that are adaptable to various brain states, tasks, and modalities. By combining signal processing and neurophysiological knowledge, we transform brain signals into reliable commands that can be used in real time.

    <h2>Motor imagery</h2>
    <p>
      In motor imagery-based ICMs, the user imagines a movement (left hand, right hand, or foot), which alters the sensorimotor rhythms of the cortex. These changes result in desynchronization (ERD) of the mu (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) bands during imagination, followed by resynchronization (ERS) after the task.

    <h2>Other Paradigms</h2>
    <p>
      Among the well-established ICM paradigms:

P300: based on an EEG peak occurring ~300 ms after a target stimulus, used in particular in text input systems.

SSVEP: uses flashing visual stimuli; the visual cortex reacts at the same frequency, allowing rapid selection from several options.

Error potentials (ErrPs): detect whether the user perceives an error, useful for adaptive interfaces.

Despite challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, inter-individual variability, and the need for calibration, non-invasive ICMs remain the most practical and scalable for real-world applications—particularly in assistance, rehabilitation, and human-machine interaction.
